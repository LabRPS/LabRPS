/**
 * @class IrpsWLZSpectrum
 * @brief An abstract class representing an vertical wind spectrum.
 *
 * This is a pure virtual class (interface) that defines the interface for all vertical wind spectrums.
 * The vertical wind component represents the wind velocity in the direction perpendicular to the ground, 
 * at a given position x in the horizontal plane and height ùëß above the surface. This component is often less 
 * intuitive than the horizontal components (along-wind and across-wind) but plays a vital role in characterizing 
 * the turbulent structure of wind fields, particularly in the context of boundary layer flows, atmospheric stability, 
 * and interaction with obstacles.      
 * Derived classes must implement all its methods. During the implementation of this interface you have 
 * to consider stationarity depending on how your feature varies in time to capture these three situation that
 * may come from the user's inputs (requirements):
 * 
 * 1-The user is willing to simulate stationary wind velocity. f = f(w)
 * 
 * 2-The user is willing to simulate non-stationary wind velocity and has also created a modulation 
 * function in the simulation. f = f(w,t) = G(w) * M(t)
 * 
 * 3-The user is willing to simulate non-stationary wind velocity without creating any
 * modulation function in the simulation. f = f(w,t)
